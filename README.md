# Apex Extension prototype

Something hacked together in very short order to demonstrate a very simple example extension/overlay, intended to be plugged in to ALGS streams to help improve the viewer experience.

Currently it only has a single static frame with a very small number of 'player' pips being drawn, but support is there for the script to poll a server once a second (timeframe adjustable) to update player positions and status.

You can also click on the map directly, which will draw a circle on the map and also add the players inside the circle to a quick display on the left-hand side. The current display is extremely crude, but I'm going to work on getting the basic UI icons hooked up next.
